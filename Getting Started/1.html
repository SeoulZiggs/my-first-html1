  <img src="photo1.jpg" width="100%">
  <p>Essentially, the purpose of photography is to communicate and document moments in time.<br>
  When you take a photograph and share it with others, you're showing <strong>a <u>moment</u> that was frozen</strong> through a picture.<br> 
  This moment can tell someone many things, from the environment to what people are doing.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Photos represent what’s important
      In our phone galleries and homes, we have images that are important to us.
      
      The reason why photography is important is that it freezes memories. It captures a moment in time that you’ll be able to remember and cherish years from now.
      
      If you look at the images that people save, usually it’s photos of their family, friends, pets, places, and items they love. You take pictures of things that are significant to you. All of the images you capture add up to tell your story.</li>
      
      <li>History through images
      There’s power in a picture because they help us understand and teach history. People connect with images and it shows how life was before the present time.
      
      How things used to look, what people wore, where they stayed, animals, and many things about the world are passed on generationally through images.
      
      Images are great for learning about history because people find that it’s easier to learn about the past through images than text.</li>
      
      <li>Photos are stories
      There’s a story behind every image. By looking at a picture, you can conclude many things about it:
      
      What do they like?
      Where are they?
      How old are they?
      How are they feeling?
      If you’re looking at photos you’ve taken of your family, you’ll be reminded of that specific moment and behind that image is a story.
      What happened that morning? Where did you go? Why did you take that picture?</li>
      
      <li>Photos evoke emotions
      Have you looked at a picture from the past and instantly felt the same emotions as you did in the picture? That’s the power of a photo.
      
      The reason you feel emotions isn’t because of how aesthetically pleasing an image is but the emotions that are expressed in the photo.</li>
      
      <li>Self-expression
      One of the best reasons that photography is important is because it allows you to express yourself. It’s a great creative outlet where you can express how you feel, what you believe, think and love.
      
      The cool thing is that you can do whatever you want. Regardless of the “rules” and techniques, photography has no boundaries. You can express yourself without any restrictions.</li>
      
      <li>Photography inspires
      Photography can inspire you to travel, enjoy life, and celebrate the moments. It can help you become more aware of the little things in life.
      
      Taking pictures inspires you to have the desire to experience more and take risks.</li>
      
      <li>Builds connections
      Through photography, you can meet a lot of people and build relationships you wouldn’t have had previously.
      With friends and family who don’t see you often, it helps them feel close when they see your images. It’s a great way to stay in touch with those who live far away.</li>
      
      <li>Photography doesn’t judge
      egardless of your age, gender or race, you can take pictures and capture memories. It doesn’t require an expensive camera, you can use any camera, even the one on your phone. You can start anytime and anywhere.
